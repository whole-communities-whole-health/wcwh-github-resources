## Create a Github account
If you do not already have a Github account, you can create one through the university here: [github.austin.utexas.edu](https://github.austin.utexas.edu/). This will redirect you to the EID login you are familiar with all around UT. Log in with your EID credentials. After you log in, verify that you can use the menu in the upper right hand corner to access your profile page.
